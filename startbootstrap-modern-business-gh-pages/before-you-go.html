    <h4>Some Helpful Information to Make Your Movie Going Experience Better</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If your theater has reserved seating and it is one of the busier days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday or discount Tuesdays) reserve your seating ahead of time. It will make sure you and your group will definitely get those seats instead of showing up and not getting seats to a showtime or movie you wanted.</li>
      <li>While you are standing in line, please look at the menu and the prices. I cannot tell you how many times I have had people who have standed in line for 10 minutes and still don't know what they want when they get to the register. This will not only move things faster for the cashier, but it will also move things along for the people who are waiting in line./li>
      <li>The prices on Google may not be correct. For the most accurate information, look on your theater's website, or if you are not sure, call the theater.</li>
      <li>The longer a movie has been out, the less show times it has.</li>
      <li>On busy nights, show up early just in case concession lines are long, that way you don't have to worry about missing the beginning of the movie.</li>
      <li>If you have a large group, consider getting a large popcorn and splitting it. Most theaters offer containers to split popcorn. Most even have refills on large popcorns, which in the end will save you more money.</li>
      <li>When the movie is finished, please take your large garbage (popcorn containers, candy boxes, cups, etc.) with you and throw it out. If the ushers have to spend time throwing away trash, they sacrifice a better clean on the theater.</li>
    </ul>
